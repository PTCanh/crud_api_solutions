#### Create Routes
Routes define how API requests are sent to backend resources. A route consists of an HTTP method and a resource path, such as GET /items. For this example, weâ€™ll create four routes.

+ GET ```/items/{id}```
+ GET ```/items```
+ PUT ```/items```
+ DELETE ```/items/{id}```

#### Steps to Create Routes

1. Login to the [API Gateway Console](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?api=unselected&region=ap-southeast-1)
2. Select **your API**

5. For **Method**, choose **GET**.

6. For **Path**, enter ```/items/{id}```. The **{id}** part is a path parameter that API Gateway will extract from the request URL.

7. Click **Create**
